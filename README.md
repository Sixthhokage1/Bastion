This is a fork of the Bastion Discord bot for the Spectra Castle server community. A public repo is maintained in the interest of transparency to the community and allowing the use of the issue tracker and pull requests, as well as potentially sharing modifications that aren't Spectra specific with upstream.

The Bastion project can be found at https://bastionbot.org or on Github at https://github.com/TheBastionBot/Bastion and you can support the project's developer k3rn31p4nic on Patreon and Paypal:
