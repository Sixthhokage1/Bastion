  "fixed": [
    "`skip` command won't go rogue anymore. It won't skip multiple songs; will skip one song at a time.",
    "Fixed an issue that prevented music commands from responding when the music channels and/or the music master role was removed from the server before removing it from Bastion."

  "improved": [
    "Renamed `setGame` to `setActivity` since Bastion now supports watching and listening activities, and game isn't the right word for it. `setGame` is now an alias for it.",
    "`userInfo` now supports watching and listening activities of users. And now, it will show *Offline* instead of *Invisible*.",
    "`setActivity` command, now, also can set the activity type to *Playing* or *Watching*.",
    "You can now cycle through the entire leaderboard as `leaderboard` is now paginated.",
    "`modules` is now an alias of `commands` command.",
    "The good old `commands` is back to how it worked earlier. We saw that new users were having trouble when it displayed modules instead of commands.",
    "Under-the-hood improvements"

  "added": [
    "Support for watching and listening activities.",
    "Create channel categories using the `createCategory` command.",

    "See the users who contribute to the code of the Bastion Bot using the `contributors` command.",
    "Reload Bastion's settings using the `reloadSettings` command. No need to restart Bastion after you've modified the `config.json` or `credentials.json` files.",
    "Browse the games in different categories of the Steam Store using the `steam` command.",
    "Forgot to add a reason for a moderation action? Don't worry, you can now edit the reason of a moderation log using the `reason` command.",
    "Organizing a competition, or any event, that need public votes? Bastion can do the heavy lifting for you. Set channels as voting channels using the `votingChannels` command and every new message in a voting channel will automatically get üëç and üëé reactions."
